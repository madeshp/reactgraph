ph visualization refers to the representation of data in a graphical or visual format where data elements are represented as nodes, and the connections between them are represented as edges or links.

Graphs in this context refer to a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between nodes). Graph visualization is commonly used to analyze and understand relationships, patterns, and structures within complex datasets. It is particularly useful in various fields such as network analysis, social network analysis, bioinformatics, and more.
